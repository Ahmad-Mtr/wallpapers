# My current Wallpapers

> ![NOTE]


- These wallpapers are sourced from many sources on the internet. I did not make all of these,  most are in  catppuccin-mocha color scheme. No credit really goes to me in that regard, I'm just the collector.
- Also check the repo that this was forked from
- there are some shots from Unsplash.
- Most pics use [Temerald](https://github.com/Ahmad-Mtr/omarchy-temerald-theme) & catppuccin-mocha color scheme, used lutgen for that

Installation Instructions below btw
