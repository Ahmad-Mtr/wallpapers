# My current Wallpapers

> [!NOTE]

- These wallpapers are sourced from many sources on the internet. I did not make all of these,  most are in  catppuccin-mocha color scheme. No credit really goes to me in that regard, I'm just the collector.
- Also check the repo that this was forked from
- there are some shots from Unsplash and ai generated images here with catppuccin-mocha as the color scheme, used lutgen for that
